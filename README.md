# Binary Mask Calculation

Using input and output values

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculo_mascaras.git`

2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

### Usage

This code takes two binary numbers as input: `sIn` and `sOut`. It returns `maskOff` and `maskOn`, based on the following calculation:

`sIn & maskOff | maskOn = sOut`

1. Run the application: `npm run system`

2. Follow the prompts to enter the `sIn` and `sOut` binary values.

3. The result will be displayed in the console. It can return binary and hex values.

Make sure to pass the `sIn` and `sOut` values as binary numbers (e.g., `10101010`) when running the code.
